# lambda expression ---> (anonymous function)
# lambda expression is a func ,and it does not have a name
# we are assign this lamda func in variable but we should not do that this for the practice thats why we ad this in variable
# actualaly we use lambda expression with built in,map,reduce,filter func

add = lambda a,b : a+b
print(add(2,3))

multiply = lambda a,b:a*b
print(multiply(2,3))

# this func hasnt a name 
print(add)
print(multiply)
# it shows just lambda itself
